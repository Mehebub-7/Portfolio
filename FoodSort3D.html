        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p> I led the development of the dynamic level progression system and implemented a variety of eateries, from fast-food joints to upscale restaurants, each requiring unique sorting challenges.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Singleton Pattern : Implemented Singleton Pattern to ensure centralized control and global access to key systems including UI, gameplay, level, and audio management.</li>
	  <li>Spritesheet : Collaborated with the UI artist to consolidate UI assets into a spritesheet for better optimization and rendering efficiency.</li>
	  <li>Texture Atlas: Collaborated with the game artist to consolidate texture assets into a texture atlas for better optimization and rendering efficiency.</li>
<li>Editor Scripting: Created a level generator tool to help designers build levels more efficiently and quickly.</li>
<li>Coroutine-Based Movement: Used coroutines for customer movement instead of the Update method, as movement was event-driven—triggered only when a customer completed their order or a queue spot became available.</li>
<li>Stack: Used the stack data structure to manage food stacking mechanics, which formed the core gameplay concept.</li>
        </ul>
